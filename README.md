# **ICU Requirement Prediction for COVID-19 Patients in Brazil**
This is the web deployment of the ICU requirement prediction model for COVID-19 patients in Brazil. You can access the web application here: ICU Requirement Prediction

## **About**
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on the Kaggle website. It consists of data related to COVID-19 patients in Brazil, with the goal of predicting whether a patient will require admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The dataset includes various attributes related to patient demographics, medical history, and current health status.


## **Dataset**
The dataset comprises records of COVID-19 patients and includes the following attributes:

## **Demographic:**
Sex: Male or Female (Nominal)
Age: Age of the patient (Continuous)

## **Methodology**
1. Data Preprocessing:
2. Handling missing values
3. Encoding categorical variables
4. Normalizing continuous variables

## **Model Building:**
Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers.
Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.
Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC
